HI THERE ! I'm Yan Wang, you can call me Sophie. I am currently a third year undergraduate student at [Glasgow College](https://www.gla.uestc.edu.cn/english/Home.htm), [UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). I used to be studying at Cambridge University (*2025.02*)

My research intersets include **automatic speech recognition** **(ASR)**,**speech emotion recognition and analysis**, **multimodal AI**, **reinforcement learning and image processing**. 

Recently, I'm focusing on:

(1) Attention-based methods for large vocabulary speech recognition

(2) Application of deep learning models in RADAR
